# Github Analtics

I wanted an application that would pull all the traffic data from my github
repositories & show me a graph & table of total pageviews & clones, along with
a breakdown per repository.

This is project is built with Haskell's
[reflex-platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform), mostly
because I wanted to try it out.
